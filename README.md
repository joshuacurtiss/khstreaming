# KH Streaming #

This project will be a template for KH Streaming. 

Copy the `config-sample.json` files to `config.json` and adjust the settings
as needed to match your congregation and system settings.

The config in the main directory defines all the congregation config locations.
Each individual congregation's details are in a separate config file, which
you can place in a subdirectory that is password-protected. When the user 
clicks the congregation button and attempts to load the congregation's config
file, the password will be requested by the browser first.
